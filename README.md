## Implementation Example

See [src/app/page.tsx](src/app/page.tsx) for an example implementation of Framer components with search filtering and item selection functionality.

The example demonstrates:

-   Search filtering across multiple fields (email, status, cost)
-   Item selection with state management
-   URL query parameter syncing with search input
-   Responsive layout with Tailwind CSS
